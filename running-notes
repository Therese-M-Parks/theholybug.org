TO RUN THE APP I HAVE TO CHANGE INDEX BACK TO HTML FOR SOME REASON.

Used these two tutorials:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g&t=1244s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzM5lETc6Sg

Main difference: I followed the first one for initial setup for installing
node and Eleventy
I followed the second one's .eleventy.js file's return statement plus reset VSCODE settings and used the return statement and nunjucks ran after that with no other additional vscode stuff. 
    return {
        dir: {
            input: "src",
            includes: "_includes",
            output: "_site",
        },
        templateFormats: ['md', 'njk', 'html'],
        markdownTemplateEngines: 'njk',
        htmlTemplateEngines: 'njk',
        dataTemplateEngines: 'njk'
    };
Then I proceeded with the first one
